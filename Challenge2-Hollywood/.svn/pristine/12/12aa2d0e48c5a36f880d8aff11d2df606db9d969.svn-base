 * Orientation
When the program starts it asks you to enter the words to search for.
The program reads one line at a time.
If the line contains the search phrase it prints the current line number and the line

Hints
You need to get the output exactly correct (including the printing a newline character at the end)
Look at the sample code in MyScriptPrinter for ideas about the basic structure of your program.
You need to use several string methods (see learning objectives) to solve this problem
You only need to compare one line at a time 
i.e. do not worry about checking  phrases that wrap over to the next line.

(These examples are meant as guides; the given unit tests are authoritative).
Example Output #1 (User input is 'spoon\n'):


Please enter the word(s) to search for
